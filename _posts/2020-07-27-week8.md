# Coding Period (1st June - 31st August)

## 20th July 2020

* Tried to get eCap PWM working, found out that pru_ecap followed little endian, so bit fields were wrong, corrected those.
* Added functionality to autodetect which BB board is being used, and automatically load it's Header<->PRU mappings.
